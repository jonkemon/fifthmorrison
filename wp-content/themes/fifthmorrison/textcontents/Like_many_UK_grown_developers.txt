Like many UK grown developers, after getting my eager little hands on a ZX Spectrum as a boy, I have been coding with many of the different technologies we have enjoyed over the years. After these early app and game attempts as a chil, I soon started to implement more serious JavaScript within the audio technology domain through my studies. This in turn lead me to development of websites within a professional context and the journey continues to roll on with the same childish enthusiam.
