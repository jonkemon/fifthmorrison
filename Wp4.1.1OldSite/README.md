# Fifth Morrison Website

The FifthMorrison website munges a variety of tech. At it's core is a customised Wordpress CMS that takes care of the blog section but then bespoke templates incorporting AngularJS are used for the rest of the site.

Styles are pre-processed using SASS + Compass to cascade over original core stylings for each viewport.

Task automation undertaken via Grunt.
Package management tools include bower and npm.

After cloning the repository:

npm install

bower install

Then run grunt to make the build.
